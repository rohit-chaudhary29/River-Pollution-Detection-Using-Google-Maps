		<h1>Here are the major factors of river pollution</h1>
		<div class="heading">
Urbanisation</div>
<p>
Rapid urbanisation in India during the recent decades has given rise to a number of environmental problems 
such as water supply, wastewater generation and its collection, treatment and disposal.
In urban areas, water is tapped for domestic and industrial use from rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, wells, etc. Nearly 80% of the water supplied for domestic use passes out as wastewater. 
In most cases, this wastewater is let out untreated and causes large scale pollution of the surface water.
		</p>

	
		<div class="heading"> Industries</div>
<p>
Most Indian rivers and other sources of fresh water are polluted by industrial wastes or effluents. All these industrial wastes are toxic to life forms that consume this water. The total wastewater 
generated from all major industrial sources is 83,048 MId which includes 66,700 Mid of cooling water generated from thermal power plants.<p>

<div class="heading">Agricultural runoff and improper agricultural practices</div>
<p>
Traces of fertilizers and pesticides are wasted into the nearest water-bodies at the onset of the monsoons or whenever there are heavy showers. As the point of entry of such agricultural inputs is diffused throughout the river basin, they are termed as non-point sources of pollution. 
Although irrigation has increased considerably in the country, little precious has been done to tackle the problem of the high salinity return water.<p>

<div class="heading">Withdrawal of Water</div>
<p>
Indian rivers, particularly the Himalayan Rivers, have plenty of water in their upper course. They are, however, starved of water when they enter the plain area. Irrigation canals whisk away clean water soon after the rivers reach the plains, denying water to flow in the river downstream.

What flows into the river is water trickling in from small insignificant streams and drains carrying untreated sewage and effluents. The river-turned drain flow downstream with 
little or no fresh water unless a large river augments the depleted flows.<p>

<div class="heading">Religious and Social Practices</div>
<p>
Religious faith and social practices also add to pollution of our river waters. Carcasses of cattle and other animals are disposed in the rivers. Dead bodies are cremated on the river banks. Partially burnt bodies are also flung into the river. All this is done as a matter of religious faith and in keeping with ancient rituals. 
These practices pollute the river water and adversely affect the water quality.
